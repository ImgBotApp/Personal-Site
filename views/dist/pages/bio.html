<div class="row"><div class="12u$"><p style="line-height:25px">I'm a Hispanic-American, born and raised in Houston, Texas. For a good chunk of my life, I believed I was going to pursue medicine, and even took a couple of courses in health science. My junior year of high school, I took Pre-AP Computer Science, which taught Java programming, for a GPA booster and immediately fell in love with programming. I think it's a really cool skill because with just a computer and internet connection, there's an infinite number of things you can build - websites, mobile apps, desktop apps, server systems, etc.</p><div class="8u" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"><a href="#" tooltips tooltip-content="My senior recital, playing the Dragonetti Concerto" tooltip-side="top"><img src="img/ds.jpg" style="max-height:170px;max-width:170px"> </a><a href="#" tooltips tooltip-content="Just a regular ol day on campus" tooltip-side="top"><img src="img/derek.jpg" style="max-height:170px;max-width:170px"> </a><a href="#" tooltips tooltip-content="My 'sexy' face" tooltip-side="top"><img src="img/derek3.jpg" style="max-height:170px;max-width:170px"> </a><a href="#" tooltips tooltip-content="yaaay football" tooltip-side="top"><img src="img/11.jpg" style="max-height:170px;max-width:170px"> </a><a href="#" tooltips tooltip-content="Recieving my 1st Dan Black Belt" tooltip-side="top"><img src="img/5.jpg" style="max-height:170px;max-width:170px"></a></div></div><br><br><p style="line-height:25px">In high school, I was quite active in extra-curricular activities, including competitive programming, orchestra, National Honor Society, Spanish National Honor Society, Tae-Kwon-Do, and did football my freshman/sophomore years.</p></div>
