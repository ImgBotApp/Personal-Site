						<h3>Programmer. Hacker. Geek.</h3>
						<p class="font16">I was born in Houston, Texas (the greatest state ever), but I am currently a student residing in Provo, UT studying computer science and mathematics at Brigham Young University. I spend a lot my time coding and practicing math (obviously), but I also enjoy a variety of other activities as well including playing the double bass, playing tennis, hiking, biking, hanging out with my roommates, playing Starcraft II and Minecraft, or just reading about whatever interesting topics Wikipedia and Reddit serve up. I am also a whiteboard fanatic.</p>

							<h2>I am a musician</h2>
							<p class="font16">I have played the double bass since I was in 5th grade, and started piano even before that. However around middle school or high school I decided to study only the bass for my musical pastime. I have had the opportunity to play many great works with my high school orchestras and university symphony orchestra including St. Paul's Suite by Gustav Holst, the Prince Igor Overture by Alexander Borodin, Concierto for Guitar and Orchestra by Rodrigo Aranjuez, the Impressario Overture by Wolfgang Mozart, Finlandia by Jean Sibilius, Carmina Burana by Karl Orff, and many other fantastic pieces of musical literature. Today I simply enjoy practicing the double bass as a form of relaxation.</p>

							<h2>I am an Artist</h2>
							<p class="font16">While I have never been good with a paint brush or colored pencils, I do believe in "beautiful code". There is just something magical about opening a .java, .m, .cpp, or .js file after a while of not working on it and having it so well commented, organized, and written that you could read it like a book. That is why I would personally go out of my way, spending however much time necessary, to get my code well-formatted and well-commented so that it is easy to understand and "beautiful".</p>

							<h2>I am a math geek.</h2>
							<p class="font16">I find math to be spectactular. Everything in this world, literally everything, can be translated into a mathematical statement. "Mathematics is the language with which God wrote the Universe." as Galileo Galilei once said. I feel that the barrier that most people run into is believing that math is a big collection of numbers and just doing tons of number crunching, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. Math is much more than algebra, geometry, and calculus. Mathematics is how Google Maps can find the directions from point A, from anywhere in the world, to point B using a branch of mathematics called Graph Theory. Cryptography is the mathematical study of encryptions and secret communication. Interactions between players in a board game or video game is studied through a mathematical branch called Game Theory. Without math, we wouldn't have any of the phenomenal advances in technology and living that we currently enjoy. We wouldn't have the physics necessary to create planes and cars or fly to the moon. We wouldn't have the computers that do so much for us. Even in "natural" non-technological items we can find math. The harmonics on stringed instruments is simply a series of fractal lengths on the string that produce natural frequencies. A fibonacci spiral can be observed in many common flowers. Math is beautiful, complex, and essential.</p>

								<p>This project, Jeopardy, was my Final Project from my Independent Study Computer Science course in high school. It is to this date the largest project I have coded strictly by myself under the supervision of my teacher <a href="http://jmellen.wikispaces.com/" target="_blank">Joel Mellen</a>. Totalling 1500+ lines, this application is a fully functioning and robust version of Jeopardy, allowing you to make your own questions and rounds, which are saved into text files. You can then choose which rounds to play, select teams or individual, and how long your question timer is (15, 30, or 45 seconds) Listed below are all the features the Jeopardy project entailed:
								<br/>
									<ul>
										<li>Select a background color for the general application</li>
										<li>Select the length of the question timer (15, 30, or 45 seconds)</li>
										<li>Multithreading to run the question listener and timer concurrently</li>
										<li>File saving/outstream to save the questions and rounds into text files</li>
										<li>File reading/instream to read the files and pull the questions and answers to be played in the game</li>
										<li>Fully Graphical User Interface</li>
										<li>Background music of the Jeopardy theme (also running concurrently)</li>

								<p>Group Smart is an app my roommate and I developed for the Mobile App Contest held by the Rollins Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology at BYU. It is an app that helps BYU students find and create study groups on campus. It is currently restricted to only BYU, but once we polish up the application and push out a corresponding web app, we plan on expanding it to other universities. My roommate did the Android, I did the iOS, and we both contributed to back-end coding which includes PHP, MySQL, and Python. Both Android and iOS were done natively.

								</div>
								<p>Sitting bored in Physics one lovely winter day, I thought of what would seem like a pretty fun project: create a simple puzzle game using simple HTML with DOM-manipulation via vanilla JavaScript. I've made quite a bit of progress on it. Essentially, you are a small block navigating through a small "maze" to reach a certain spot. Includes walls, portals, and "death squares". The graphics are extremely simple (literally HTML divs with a background color) but the purpose of this was to make me more comfortable with JavaScript and learn how I can use it to make websites more interactive, such as overriding arrow-key functions. It has also come to make me more familiar with HTML layouts such as relative versus absolute positioning. Unfortunately I have had not had time to come back to it due to midterms, the <a href="http://www.mobileapp.byu.edu" target="_blank">Mobile App Contest</a>, work, etc.</a></p>

					<div class="center-block">
						<p class="font16">Project Euler is probably (in my opinion) the best tool to create logical, witty, and efficient programmers. It is a large collection of math-based questions and puzzles for which you must write a short program to solve. I love these kind of problems because it doesn't test your knowledge of a certain technology, but your problem-solving skills which I believe to be far more valuable. If you can solve these problems in a programming language, chances are you will have no problem picking up other languages as needed. My high school computer science teacher told me that once you know one language, you know them all. And he's correct, but he's not referring to syntax. He is talking about the logic and programming concepts such as boolean operations, loops, if-statements, etc. Knowing how to implement these basic tools to create complex logic is a powerful tool. Hopefully after this semester ends I'll have much more time to get back on this.<br/></p>

						<h3>Languages</h3>
						<p class="font16">Java, C++, Lua, Python, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (jQuery and AJAX), PHP, Objective-C</p>
						<h3>Development</h3>
						<p class="font16">Web, desktop, mobile, embedded systems.</p>
						<h3>Other</h3>
						<p class="font16">Windows, Linux, OSX, Google Drive API, Twitter Bootstrap, RESTful Framework, Django, Android SDK, iOS SDK, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Atmel AVR microcontrollers, digital circuitry</p>
						<h3>Java</h3>
						<p class="font16">Java was my first language which I learned through the AP Computer Science curriculum and naturally my favorite. Most of my learning-programming has been through Java, as well as competitive programming (<a href="" onclick="window.openHere('http://www.hpcodewars.org/', '_blank').focus()">HP CodeWars</a>, UIL, etc.). It is my initial go-to language for a new project idea. I have not pursued much serious development in Java in favor for other technology such as PHP for web apps or mobile development on Objective-C.</p>
						<h3>C++</h3>
						<p class="font16">C++ is the language of the lower-level computer science courses at BYU, including Data Structures & Algorithms as well as Discrete Mathematics which I have completed. Projects I have completed in C++ (all school-related) include various data structures such as linked lists, doubly linked lists, stacks, binary search trees, AVL trees, Huffman encoding trees, and also a Datalog interpreter.</p>
						<h3>PHP</h3>
						<p class="font16">PHP is my usual back-end language for web development. I started learning PHP to help develop the website for The DreamPress and now use it for practically any web app that I create for fun.</p>
						<h3>Python</h3>
						<p class="font16">Python is my usual scripting language, particularly for needs as a webcrawler. I also use Python at my current job for a web back-end with the Django Framework.</p>
						<h3>HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript</h3>
						<p class="font16">These three are of course a staple to web development. No much else needed to be said here...</p>
						<h3>Lua + Corona SDK</h3>
						<p class="font16">Not having developed any serious apps using Lua, I have messed around with it and created two practice apps. One is DiscoWindows which is a cross between Simon Says and Dance Dance Revolution, but for your fingers. The other is a classic siderunner game.</p>
						<h3>MySQL</h3>
						<p class="font16">My usual databasing language for all of my personal projects. Again, not much needed to be said here.</p>
						<h3>Objective-C</h3>
						<p class="font16">Long story short, BYU held a mobile app contest that my roommate I wanted to enter. He did Android, I rented out a Macbook and learned iOS. We won $400 for the app and now my internship has me doing iOS development full time.</p>
