        <p>An augmented-reality game for Apple Watch and iPhone where users can
        drop virtual traps into the actual world for their friends to run into.
        Heavily utilizes geographic programming concepts such as geofencing and
        Apple's Core Location services. Parse powered the backend.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>Lunchbox is a mobile app that helps college students find free food
        events at their campus. Organizations can pay to host their event on the
        app. Originally founded by David Hepworth and Chase Roberts, I joined
        the crew to help revamp the app as well as its Django backend.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>Groupsmart is a mobile app to help students easily find and create
        study groups by providing an app specialized to do so, thus providing
        a single source rather than scrounging around for study groups via
        social media and word of mouth. Originally founded by myself and my
        roommate at the time Hunter Kehoe, we built v1.0 of this app for a
        mobile app contest hosted by the Rollins Center for Entrepreneurship
        and Technology, in the BYU Marriott School of Management. We won $400
        for our entry, and I would now like to improve the app. The backend was
        in PHP and MySQL but that has since been updated to Django + PostgreSQL.
        I wrote the native iOS app and Hunter wrote the Android counterpart.

        <p>Projects is a Github repository containing many simple project ideas
        for learning or mastering a language. I hope to find the time to do
        these projects in Java, Python, Go, Haskell, JavaScript, Swift, and
        Objective-C. Maybe PHP but I already have a lot planned.</p>
